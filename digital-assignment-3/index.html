<h2>Your game title</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game? 
Not very much. Most of the code is borrowed heavily from 
https://phaser.io/examples/v2/p2-physics/mouse-spring
with smatterings from the making your first Phaser game tutorial.
My additions were merely, the background, the player sprite and the ground.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology? 
The physics used in the mouse spring is very intuitive and fun to play
with so I wanted to figure out how to use it well enough to implement one
of my physical games from one of the previous assignments. I should have 
known better!
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
That aiming low and succeeding is preferable to failure.
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
Coming to terms with the lack of compiler-based error checking.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.

</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Toss the Urn containing your grandmother's ashes around in the sky.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the Storymatic themes you used.
Grandmother's ashes
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
Physics based control system.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
Casual Fun.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototype’s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
You can use your mouse to throw an urn around the screen. There is a circle of radius 20 which you can click on with your pointer in order to throw the urn. The pointer consists of a smaller circle of radius 10. My original plan was to have goal posts from American Football so that you could try
to get a field goal with your grandmother's ashes.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
There are no particular strategies at this time.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
Essentially it runs on shock value much like Kitten Cannon. There was no real thought given to worldbuilding beforehand.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
Children, or those with the mind of one.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?
As long as one wishes to continue. 
</li>
