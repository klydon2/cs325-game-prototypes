<h2>Your game title</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game? 
This time around I tried to work with collision boxes and score keeping.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology? 
The physics used in the mouse spring is very intuitive and fun to play
with so I wanted to figure out how to use it well enough to implement one
of my physical games from one of the previous assignments. For this game, I used collision detection to simulate catching raindrops in a bucket. The random number generator to vary the 
position on the x axis led to some very amusing results.

</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
Collision groups make event handling much easier once you figure them out. Restarting a game is hard without figuring out game.state. Math.random can be very interesting when used incorrectly.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Catch the rain! Drink the rain! Don't die of thirst!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the Storymatic themes you used.
Catch
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
Mouse based input. A lot of randomness. Achiever play style
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
Physics based control system.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
Casual Fun.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototype’s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
Mouse based input to drag the bucket around the screen to catch raindrops. Keeps count of how many you catch and how many hit the ground. You lose once you miss ten.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
Catch the water as low as possible as the rain loses momentum as it bounces off the walls.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
There isn't really much in the way of a story to be honest. Collect water in a bucket to drink it.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
Children, or those with the mind of one.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?
As long as one manages to catch water.
</li>
