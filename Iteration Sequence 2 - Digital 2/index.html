<h2>Who Wants To Be An Americanaire?</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game? 
<li> Changed format completely this time around. Big mistake. Decided to go for a quiz based game. Phaser + text == disaster.
<li> Only managed to implement one question and the basic interface for this iteration. Will have around 30 civics questions and a scoring mechanism added by thursday.

</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology? 
<li> Tried my hand at abstraction in JS to horrendous results. The way in which JS uses 'this' is confusing and the documentation was not made with readability in mind.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
<li> Don't try new things for the last project of the class.
<li> EventListeners are strange, JS is strange, abstraction is hard work.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
<li>http://standardflags.com/shop/american-flag/ 


<ul>
<li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
<li>https://phaser.io/examples/v2/text/text-events

</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Pass the test! Become a Citizen!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the Storymatic themes you used.
<li>NA
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
<li>Mouse based input, knowledge based, Quiz, Achiever Playstyle
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
<li> Text based quiz formatting and mouse event detection.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
<li> Educational
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototype’s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
<li> The player used the mouse to click on the correct answer to the question. The game will ask 10 questions at random and the player wins if the get >6 right.(not implemented yet)

</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
<li>Googling answers.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
<li> A dystopia where foreigners are allowed to become citizens by memorizing multiple choice questions that citizens don't care to know the answer to. 
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
<li> Those who wish to take the citizenship civics exam.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?
<li>Until ten questions are answered.
</li>
